# Ansible Builder

Ansible Builder is a tool that automates the process of building execution
environments using the schemas and tooling defined in various Ansible
Collections and by the user.


See the readthedocs page for `ansible-builder` at:

https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Execution Environments

Execution environments are container images intended to be used by Ansible
executors.  Starting in version 2.0,
[ansible-runner](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner) can make use of
these images.

An execution environment is expected to contain:

 - An install of Ansible (as `ansible-base` if 2.10 or higher)
 - An install of `ansible-runner`
 - Ansible collections
 - Python and/or system dependencies of
   - modules/plugins in collections
   - or content in `ansible-base`
   - or custom user needs

Execution environments contain everything needed to use Ansible modules and
plugins, as local actions, inside of automation.
